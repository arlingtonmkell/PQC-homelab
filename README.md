# PQC-homelab

## Overview
The **PQC-homelab** project is dedicated to exploring and implementing **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)** algorithms.

## Why PQC Matters
Quantum computers will eventually break classical cryptography like RSA and ECC. PQC ensures future-proof encryption and security.

## Goals
- Implement NIST-approved PQC algorithms.
- Benchmark performance of post-quantum cryptography.
- Study migration strategies from classical to quantum-safe systems.
